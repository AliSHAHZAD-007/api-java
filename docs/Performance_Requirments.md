# Requirements

1. **Response Time:**
   - The web API must respond to 95% of requests within 500 milliseconds under normal load conditions.
   - The maximum response time for any request should not exceed 2 seconds.

2. **Throughput:**
   - The system should support a minimum of 1,000 requests per second per server.
   - The API must scale horizontally to handle a load increase of up to 20% beyond the expected maximum.

3. **Scalability:**
   - The web API should be able to handle a 50% increase in concurrent users within a one-hour timeframe.

4. **Time Behavior:**
   - The average response time for critical transactions should not exceed 300 milliseconds.

5. **Resource Utilization:**
   - The API should operate with a CPU utilization of less than 70% and a memory utilization of less than 60% under normal conditions.
