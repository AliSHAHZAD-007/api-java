# Requirements

1. **Data Encryption:**
   - All data transmitted between the client and the server must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or later).

2. **Authentication:**
   - The API must employ robust authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth 2.0, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data.

3. **Authorization:**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) must be implemented to ensure that users have the appropriate permissions for their actions.

4. **Injection Prevention:**
   - The web API must be protected against common injection attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), following OWASP guidelines.

5. **Audit Logging:**
   - The system must log all security-related events, including login attempts, access to sensitive data, and any potential security breaches.

6. **Confidentiality:**
   - All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest using strong encryption algorithms.

7. **Integrity:**
   - Data integrity checks must be performed at each stage of data processing to prevent tampering.
